# Mask-Detection

### Introduction
When a photo of a human face(preferably with white background) is uploaded, the machine learning model will detect whether the person is wearing a mask or not.

### Prerequisites
- Python == 3.6
- Tensorflow == 2.2
- Numpy == 1.18
- Google Colab

### Instructions
1. Clone the repository into google colab
2. The dataset is provided in the repository as "Mask_Datasets" folder.
The folder has the hierarchy:
  - Train
    - Mask
    - No_mask
  - Validation
    - Mask
    - No_mask

The hierarchy should be preserved for the code to work.

3. You might get the need to change directory names in the 2nd cell as per how the files are stored in your colab.(In the code,/content/ represents the directory of colab)
